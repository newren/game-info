Determining whether my strategies are working:
  ./levelling.py --until '2015-02-16 21:07:07' --compare --until now --compare
  # Check who has levelled the most, ignoring low-level characters, with ttl
  # adjustments being a good backup.  As of 03-13, j & kniktas were leading me

Determining what battle-adjusted itemsums folks have used over time:
   cat ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | grep -v 'team battled' | grep -o '[A-Za-z0-9]* \[[0-9/]*\]' | sort -k 1,1 -s | sed -e s#[0-9]*/## | uniq -c | less

Determining the latest battle-adjusted itemsums folks are now using:
   cat ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | grep -v 'team battled' | grep -o '[A-Za-z0-9]* \[[0-9/]*\]' | sort -k 1,1 -s | sed -e s#[0-9]*/## | tr -d '[]' | uniq -c | awk '{cnt[$2]=$3} END{for (x in cnt){print cnt[x],x}}' | sort -n | less

Determining what level everyone has attained:
   grep 'has attained' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | sed -e 's/.*idlerpg>\s*//' -e 's/,[^,]*, has attained//' -e 's/!.*//' | awk '{cnt[$1]=$3} END{for (x in cnt){print cnt[x],x}}' | sort -n | less

Determining alignment; combination of (the first only goes back to when my logs started)
   grep alignment ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | awk '{print $5 " => " $10'} | less
   grep forsaken ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | awk {print\$5} | sort | uniq -c
   grep prayed ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | sed -e 's/.*[^A-Za-z]\([A-Za-z].*\) and \(.*\) have not let.*/\1 \2/' | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c
   

grep '<idlerpg>' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log | grep -v -e 'has come upon' -e 'Critical Strike' -e 'has challenged .* in combat' -e 'has attained level' -e 'uest to end' -e 'reaches next level' -e 'Next level in' -e 'This terrible calamity' -e 'This wondrous godsend' -e 'completing their quest' -e 'Idle RPG Top Players' -e 'have team battled' -e 'completed their journey' -e '10%.* effectiveness' -e 'have been chosen by the gods' -e 'In the fierce battle' -e 'blessed hand of God' -e 'prayed to their god' -e 'His little finger among them' -e 'prudence and self-regard' 

 'has come upon' 
 'Critical Strike' 
 'has challenged .* in combat' 
 'has attained level' 
 'uest to end' 
 'reaches next level' 
 'Next level in' 
 'This terrible calamity' 
 'This wondrous godsend' 
 'completing their quest' 
 'Idle RPG Top Players' 
 'have team battled'

 'In the fierce battle' 
 'blessed hand of God' 
 'prayed to their god'

 'prudence and self-regard' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log


grep -e 'Luck is with you' -e 'The light of the gods' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-idlerpg.log | grep -o 'level [^,!]*!' | tac | perl -nle 'print if not $seen{(split(/ /, $_, 3))[2]}++' | sort -k 2 -n

   or tack the following on the end of the above: | grep -v tunic | awk '{sum+=$2} END{print sum}'

(grep -e 'Luck is with you' -e 'The light of the gods' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-idlerpg.log; grep 'elijah picks it up' -e 'elijah stole ' ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Palantir-#idlerpg.log) | grep -o 'level [^,!]*!' | tac | perl -nle 'print if not $seen{(split(/ /, $_, 3))[2]}++' | sort -k 2 -n

   or tack the following on the end of the above: | grep -v '[0-9]\+ [A-Z]' | awk '{sum+=$2} END{print sum}'

The above assumes any special items I got were later replaced by fierce
battles or steals, assumes that any steals or fierce battle-obtained-items
weren't ever later replaced by an item after going up to a new level,
assumes that I've never had an item taken from me in a fierce battle (false
-- pair of boots), and ignores blessings/cursings on my items.

scatterplot:
  TTL vs actual-TTL  (maybe also itemsum vs. average itemsum,alignment,current-level,etc.)
